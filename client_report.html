            <h2>Client Report</h2>
            <p>
                I decided on the content for this site before I knew this project existed, at the beggining of the semester I thought "hey, that's a site I want to make" and it fit well enough for this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                I communicated with my developer over email, there were no issues with that.
            </p>
            <p>
                My developer mostly met my expectations, but theres a few things very off. the first draft I saw of the site was completely off, so asked him to fix it, and it got much better. there are still many things wrong, such as not following the wireframes very well, missing most of the images on the meeses page, putting text that was meant for the developers only onto the site, and not adding a second "random" page. some of this could definately be the fault of a poor site plan, such as the developer only text.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I would do differently as a client next time is make a better, clearer site plan.

            <h2>Lead Dev Report</h2>
            <p>
                I communicated with my devs over email, once I got them added to the github, I assigned one subpage to each and did the home page myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I communicated with my client over email, there were no problems with communication there.
            </p>
            <p>
                I published the site through github, and gave my client the link when he requested it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Managing the site on github made things very easy, both for the junior dev's work and for working on the site from both my laptop and PC.

            <h2>Junior Dev Report</h2>
            <p>
                For site 1 I used email, for site 2 I used texting to communicate. there were no issues with this.
            </p>
            <p>
                For both sites I was assigned a subpage to work on, which made knowing what was expected of me very easy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was able to contribute one subpage to each site.
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn't run into any issues with github for either of the sites, but for one of them the github provided url isn't working and the settings page is giving a 404.

            <h2>General Experience</h2>
            <p>
                The hardest part of this project was taking ~200 pictures for my site plan.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I enjoyed most about this project was being a lead dev, I liked having controll of how well the final product came out.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I were to do this project again, I would make a better site plan and use a tool other than MS paint for the wireframes.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do feel more confident about working on real-world projects after this, mainly because of the github experience.
